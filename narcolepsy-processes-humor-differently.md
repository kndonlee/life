* Italian & Norwegian research
* Narcoleptics experience humor differently (via brain imaging)
* Amusemement/positive emotions can trigger cataplexy/paralysis/muslce weakness
* Thought as autoimmune attack on brain that regular sleep and wake
* Cataplexy is thought to come from paralysis that accompanies REM sleep, keeping people from acting out dreams
* For narcoleptics, paralysis seems to spill over into waking time

* University of Bologna neurologists have children and teenagers with narcolepsy watch short movies (roadrunner, coyote cartoons, youtube cat videos) and choose between funny videos, while waiting EEG electrods inside MRI
* Narcoleptics have BROADER pattern of metabolic activity lighting up the brain when they laugh, but do not experience cataplexy, healthy controls much less so.
* people were trying to exert deliverate control over cataplexy events, like sensing and holding back a sneeze

* some can use tricks to avoid cataplexy
* zona incerta (region in brain) was only activated during laughter in people with narcolepsy, not in controls. helps control fear associated behavior

* even without cataplexy, narcoleptics respond differently to humor
  * study: watch movie clips with joke punch lines and not, also rate the clip
    * mri showed no difference in brain activation between narcoleptics and controls for both scenarios
    * differences only came for movie clips with punch lines that were rated neutral
    * narcoleptics showed MORE brain activation compared to controls connected with emotional processing and RED sleep
    * some parts of narcoleptic brains reacted as if moves were funny even though they rated movie clips as not funny
    * Stine Knudsen: phenomenmon may reflect being on guard to hypersensitivty to potential humorous stimuli
  * anger, surprise, dissapointment also brings on cataplexy
    * Julie Flygare (narcoleptic): cataplexy more likely to be caused by social interaction and communication with people close than by a movie or stand up comedy club
