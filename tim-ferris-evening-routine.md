Evening Routine

* make tea + apple cider vinegar, unfiltered honey to help sleep
  * helps knock out to sleep
* soaking tub, 15 mins to fill
* read fiction while waiting for fill in order to slow down brain instead of problem solving mode
* water + ice in thermos
* uses hyroflask as a foam roller
* epsom salts poured into soaking tub, not a jacuzzi

all helps with sleeping
