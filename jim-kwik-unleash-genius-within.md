# Introduction

* Genius can be learned despite
* we are paid for brain strength not brut strength
* There is trained memory and untrained memory
* Knowledge is super power, can not do well if one los half of memories
* Do not touch phone for the first hour of the day
  * Phone enhances distractions during alpha stage
* Brain Injury, slow learner, maybe can learn to have a faster brain
* Difficult times can develop us as opposed to diminishing us
* People say: Human race is doomed, media corrupted us, planet has no future.
  * Humanity is full of hope and salvation is within each of us
  * Listening is oldest method of learning
* Extraordinary people may inspire you to change

# Interview Start

* Depth of life comes from learning and living and having wonder
* There is always something incredible going on, should not be bored
* Stories are in our dna and is a learning mechanism around campfires.
* Similarities/Themes amongst high performance people?
  * Common thread is that they are life long learners or meta-learning (learning how to learn)
  * They have high standard for things and a vision to set goals and executing with hands
  * Have heart and drive to achieve things
  * we are not always logical, but biological, doing things via hormones, serotonin, dopamine, etc
  * High drive (some call it purpose)
  * Reasons reap results, and a lot of rewards
  * we grow the most when practicing and operating at our limits
  * Structure of scientific Revolution (book)
    * All the advancements and evolutions and innovations come from someone outside the industry.  takes people from outside looking in, what could they be?  So it's not additive, but fresh perspectives that upend the status quo..

# If learning is uncomfortable, how to maintain balance of being present and happy?

* It is up to the individual and their preferences.
  * People give away their sovereignty and power to other people that they consider experts or gurus, but ultimate expert is self.  self-awareness is a superpower.
* To feel fulfilled:
  * Curiosity to know self
  * Once you know self, then Courage to be self
* The life we live are the lessons we teach.  It is not about what we say, if we are not doing we do not really understand it.
* So many of us are shrinking because we value other people's opinions and expectations too much.  It is hard to be one's self based on parents ideas or keeping up with jones.
* You can go broke buying into other people's opinions and expectations.
* Humans are here to grow and give


# What do large companies expect Jim Kwik to give them?

* If I could ask a genie for wishes, the hack is to ask for more wishes.
  * Learning how to learn can be applied to anything and becomes a force multiplier.
  * I focus on meta learning, thinking about thinking
* companies know that the only constant is change
  * we feel like we are drowing in information, but starving for practical wisdom
  * the ability to learn faster is the most important skill
  * By shaving 1-2 hours a day just by faster reading, one can save 365 to 730 hours/yr and this creates time
  * 4-5 hours/day of reading means half of salary paid just to read. half used to process information
  * Information fatigue syndrome affects personal life, which affects professional life.
  * Memory training - "I forgot" is the most costly 2 words.   We lose time, credibility and income based on "I forgot"
* Clinton has a powerful presence. When you are out and about, most people aren't listening, but thinking about how to respond or waiting for turn to talk.
  * Presence comes from being powerfully present.
  * Problem is people are learning and developing muscles of distraction. especially with tech because of smart devices.
  * Each distraction is a dopamine hit, novelty wears away then they look for another hit.  The presence of phone on table stresses people out.
* Memory is valuable because there is no knowledge without it
  * Our life right now is sum total of all decisions made to this point and we can only make a good decision with good information
  * If you forgot half of everything, how effective would you be?
  * What if you could retain 2x the information in a fraction of the time, how much more effective can you be?
  * Having information in head means they come off as more expert, thus are rewarded more.
  * knowledge is not just power, but also profit.  and not just financial but all treasures of life.
  * smart devices are the ultimate designer drug

# How do you interact with your device and what do you teach to people who's job it is to be wired and connected.

* practical advice: what can people do today?
  * can read a book a day and memorize a bunch of names.
  * demo not to impress, but to show what's possible and that all people can do it and more.
  * People can't do it because they weren't taught.  we were taught that intellgience is fixed like shoe size, but it is not.
  * We have learned more in the past 10 years about the brain than previous 1000 years.  We grossly underestiamte our capacity
* grew up with brain injury at 5
  * as jim kwik was watching firetrucks standing on chair, another kid pulled out the chair and he fell head first
  * in school became learning challenged: bad focus, poor memory, and took 4 years longer just to learn to read
    * Only innate fears are falling and loud noises.
      * public speaking is learned fear. (reflecting on reading out loud in class)
      * trying to read aloud in school made jim kwik nervous.
      * learned how to read via comic books
      * comic books, the words didn't mean anything, but the themes heped him to learn.
* modern day super heroes
   * worlds needs them
   * obviously not leaping over towers or shooting lasers from eyes
   * but people with unique talents, strengths, abilities
   * people need to discover  talents, strengths, ablities and develop them
  * super power alone doesn't make a superhero, gotta use the super power to serve and make the world a better place.

# Digital super villains are:

* digital overload, too much info, too little time
* digital distraction
* other generations didn't have digital super villains


* digital overload, too much info, too little time
   * how to learn faster and read faster to compensate

* digital distraction
   * driven by smart devices
   * high performers don't touch phone first hour of the day
   * touching phone not out of need but out of habit
   * how to create better habits
     * Dr BJ Fog:
       * B = MAP
       * Behavior (habit) = motivation, ability, prompt
     * Average person opening instagram 150x/day
   * 4 brain wave states
     * beta - awake
     * delta - sleep
     * theta (in and out of sleep) (often in showers, where best ideas come from)
     * alpha - below beta, a state of accelerated learning: relaxed learning and just absorb information.  TV puts people into alpha state and become entranced.
   * genius (not iq, but high performers) leaves clues, there's a trail to follow
   * theta and alpha is most important for learning
   * figure out how to get into alpha state to get information ingested faster.
* classes weren't about how to learn, it focused on what: science, math, etc, need to focus on:
   * how to think
   * how to make decisions
   * how to focus and concetrate
   * how to read faster
   * how to remember more
* alpha state is very suggestible and that rewires brain
* phone reduces level of productivity and performance, esp during alpha state.
   * enforces how to be distracted, rewires brain not to focus on conversation cuz brain is trained to do otherwise
   * that is why mindfulness is important.
* meditate not for peace/zen
  * do it as an mental exercise to improve cognitive capabilities
  * meditation reinforces brain focus muscle: when mind goes elsewhere, can pull it back with breath and visualization.
* turn nouns into verbs. People say I hope I have energy/motivation/creativity/memory/focus
* these are not things you have, they are things you do.
  * you do not have love, but do loving things
  * you do not have energy, do things that give energy
  * you do not have focus, there is a process for doing focus
  * you do not have memory, there's steps to improve memory
  * you do not have creativity, there is a process for creativity
    * should not suffer from writers block.  
* study your brain for a boost.  gives a esteem boost.  helps you in all things in life.  that's why the brain is so important.
  * training for iron man, everyone knows what to do, but do they DO what they know?
    * common sense isn't common practice
    * myth: knowledge is power.
      * knowledge only has potential to be power.
      * only has power when we use it.
* There is not just a learning curve, but there is a Forgetting curve:
  * if you learn something once, within 48 hours 80% is gone
  * phone trains brain to be reactive.  starting day with text/phone that is bad, which ruins day, and ability to have quality life
* Inbox is organizational system for other people's agenda for YOUR life.
  * how can you have vision for your life reacting to email (other people's agenda)?
* sleep is so important.  night time routine to enable self
  * no screens due to blue light which inhibits melatonin production
  * also writes down 3 things to accomplish today personally, then professionally.
  * when you wake up you have a vision for your life.
    * Doesn't touch phone until 1 thing is done.
    * Behavior is not always perfect, but it is about progress.
    * practice makes progress.
* trust yourself as expert instead of someone else, and test it.
* spend first hour a day as a thermostat (proactive)  NOT a thermometer (reactionary)
* happiest people are those who believe they have control within, and not reactive to external stimuli.
 * thermostat sets a goal and the temp raises to it.
