First rule of success is to have a vision

* No vision/goal leads to merely drifting around going no where
* Best ship or airplane in the world, captain not knowing where to go just drifts and ends up in wrong place
* Fortunate to stumble upon his vision
* Born in 1947 Austria after WWII, didn't like austria, couldn't wait to get out
* did not see self as a farmer, worker in factory, even though parents wanted to stay and have normal life.  father wanted arnold to become police office like father.  mother wanted to just stay and marry a heidi and have kids
* that was parents vision not arnolds
* felt was born for something special, unique, big
* great to feel knowing where they are going, majority of people do not know where they are going
* when there is a goal/vision, everything becomes easy
* in america, percentage of people: 74% hate jobs.  Same in europe.
* people don't like what they are doing because they do not have a goal in mind
* there's a job opening, so they just get a job
* but the work is a chore, not fun
* only quarter of people enjoy what they do in life, that is unbelievable
* blessed because arnold knew what he was doing
* Med student knows the path to becoming a doctor, arnold knew where he was going
* people ask: when they saw in gym, why working out so hard, 5-6 hrs/day and smiling?
  * others working just as hard and look sour
  * i'm shooting for a goal, mr universe title.  each rep gets closer to accomplishing that goal/vision to turn it into reality
  * each rep will get closer to reality, so he couldn't wait to do another 500lb squat
  * couldn't wait to do another 2000 situps, and doing posing
* at 20, went to london and won mr universe, and because there was a goal
* visualizing goal and going after it makes it fun
* got to have a vision/purpose.

Second rule: Don't listen to the naysayers

* people said: that's impossible, that can't be done, no
* when people said no, I heard yes.
* nelson mandella: everything is always impossible until someone does it
* said to self, I'm going to be do it, and I did not listen to the naysayers

Third rule: work your ass off

* no magic pill
* must work and work and work
* people say they don't have time (45 mins) to go work out
* just do something 45 minutes a day to improve, whether it is physical or mental
* imagine you read one hour a day about history, how much will you learn after 365 hours, in year
* study about musicions/composers, how much would you know.
* imagine how much further along you would go and get.
* 24 hours, sleep 6, 18 hours
  * just sleep faster
  * with 18 hours, avg person works 8-10 hours.  8 hours.  travel time, there's 6 hours left
  * what do do with 6 hours?  Time is available if the day is organized
  * went to college, worked out 5 hours/day, and worked construction.  no money in body building, and went to acting class 4x/week.  not 1 minute wasted.
* became friendly with muhammed ali, and saw he worked his butt off
* sports writer asks muhammed how many he does, reply: "I don't start counting until it starts to hurt"
  * don't start counting until feeling pain.  that is working hard.  can't get around the hard work.  doesn't matter who it is.
  * Ted Turner: Work like hell, and advertise (let world know about your work)

I Hate Plan B

* so many doubters/naysayers. When you start doubting self, that's very dangerous.
* when plan doesn't work, you have a fall back plan.
  * that means you start thinking about plan b
  * every thought towards plan b takes away thought and energy from plan a
  * we function better if there is no safety net
  * plan b becomes a safety net, so if we fall, we know something will protect me
  * people perform better if there is not a plan b
  * dangerous to have plan b because you are cutting yourself off from the chance of really succeeding
  * main reason for plan b is worried about failing
* don't be afraid of failing
  * nothing wrong with failing
  * no one climbs without failing
  * we all fail, it's okay
* in other cases, when you fail, you stay down
  * whoever stays down is a loser, and winners will fail and get up
  * they always get up, that is a winner
* we all lose, we all have losses
* if you are afraid of losing then you get frozen and not relaxed.
* in order to perform at best, you must relax
* give it all out and give everything you have

one of 6 rules for success

* can only feel complete as a person if you think about what can you do for fellow person that may need help
* everyone has a different motivation
* came to america with nothing, america was generous, and people helped, invited to thanksgiving and gave utensils and plates from people. Received much generosity from the gym. so was inspired to give something back.
